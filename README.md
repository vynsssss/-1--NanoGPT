# GPT Training Script - Explanation

This repository contains a training script for a GPT-like model, which can be run on both a single GPU or using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) for multi-GPU training. Below is a breakdown of the key sections of the code and how they function.

## 1. Script Overview
The script can be run in the following ways:
- On a single GPU:
  ```
  python train.py --batch_size=32 --compile=False
  ```
- With DDP on multiple GPUs (single or multi-node):
  ```
  torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train.py
  ```

## 2. Key Imports
The script imports several modules, including:
- **Standard Python Modules**: `os`, `time`, `math`, `pickle`, `contextlib.nullcontext`
- **Numerical Operations**: `numpy (np)`
- **PyTorch**: The main deep learning library.
- **Distributed Training**: `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel (DDP)` and `torch.distributed` functions.

## 3. Suppressing Compilation Errors
The following code disables specific Torch compilation errors to avoid crashes:
```python
import torch._dynamo
torch._dynamo.config.suppress_errors = True
```

## 4. Model Configuration and Initialization
```python
from model import GPTConfig, GPT
```
These classes are custom-defined in a separate `model.py` file, which define the GPT model configuration and architecture.

## 5. Configuration Variables
The script sets up default values for various parameters, such as:
- `out_dir`: Directory to save model checkpoints and logs.
- `eval_interval`: Number of iterations before running evaluation.
- `eval_only`: If `True`, the script exits after the first evaluation.
- `init_from`: Specifies whether to initialize the model from scratch or resume from a checkpoint.

## 6. Training and Model Parameters
- **WandB Logging**: Disabled by default. Set up for tracking training metrics.
- **Dataset**: Set to use `openwebtext` by default.
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Controls how many gradient steps are accumulated before updating the model parameters.

## 7. Distributed Data Parallel Setup
The script checks if DDP is enabled using this flag:
```python
ddp = int(os.getenv('LOCAL_RANK', -1)) != -1
```
If DDP is enabled, the script initializes the process group for multi-GPU training.

## 8. Model Loading
The GPT model is loaded with specified parameters:
```python
model_args = dict(n_layer=12, n_head=12, n_embd=768)
model = GPT(GPTConfig(**model_args))
```

## 9. Training Loop
The script contains a main training loop that handles data loading, forward pass, backpropagation, and loss scaling:
```python
for iter_num in range(max_iters):
    X, Y = get_batch('train')
    with ctx: # mixed precision training
        logits, loss = model(X, Y)
        loss = loss / gradient_accumulation_steps
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
```

## 10. Gradient Clipping and Optimization
Gradients are clipped to prevent exploding gradients, and the optimizer updates the model parameters:
```python
if grad_clip != 0.0:
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), grad_clip)
scaler.step(optimizer)
scaler.update()
```

## 11. Logging
Logs are printed after a set number of iterations to track the loss:
```python
if iter_num % log_interval == 0:
    lossf = loss.item() * gradient_accumulation_steps
    print(f"iter {iter_num}: loss {lossf:.4f}")
```

## 12. Distributed Training Cleanup
At the end of training, the process group is destroyed if distributed training was used:
```python
if ddp:
    destroy_process_group()
```

## Usage
To train the model, you can run the script in different modes depending on your setup (single GPU or multi-GPU with DDP). Adjust the configuration values to fit your specific task.
